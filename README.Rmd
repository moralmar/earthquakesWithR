# earthquakesWithR

The goal of `earthquakesWithR` is to give a few handy visualization tools for the NOAA data set. It provides to the user of this package the following functions:  
- **geom_timeline()** - which is a specific geom for the `ggplot2` package  
- **geom_timeline_label()** - which is an extension for the above geom  
- **eq_location_clean()** - which is a helper function, cleaning the NOAA dataset  
- **eq_clean_data()** - a function which loads and applies a few cleaning function to it  
- **eq_map()** - a function creating a `leaflet` map and visualizing the earth quakes  
- **eq_create_label()** - is a helper function, creating a nice pop-ups in the leaflet map

## Installation

You can install `earthquakesWithR` from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moralmar/earthquakesWithR")
```

## Data

The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami.  
Feel free to browse through the code as follows:  

```{r example}
# To load the earth quake data and have a look:
data("NOAAearthquakes")

# the following is a spatial polygon data frame, which merely gives a nice touch to the leaflet map
# hence, there is not much to see here
data("world")
```

## Example - Timeline

Here are three simple examples, showing  
- a single country without labels  
- a single country with labels  
- and showing multiple countries, also with lables

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  fig.width = 15, fig.asp = .32}
require(earthquakesWithR)
require(magrittr) # for piping operator
require(dplyr) # for filter/subsetting functions
require(ggplot2) # should be obvious :)
require(ggthemes) # for the theme_classic()

# Load the data and filter it accordingly to your needs
quakes <- eq_clean_data()
quakes_filtered <- quakes %>%
        filter(COUNTRY %in% c("USA") & YEAR >= 1000)

# single country without labels
ggplot() +
        geom_timeline(data = quakes_filtered, aes(x = date, y = COUNTRY, color = TOTAL_DEATHS, size = EQ_PRIMARY)) +
        theme_classic()
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  fig.width = 15, fig.asp = .32}
# Load the data and filter it accordingly to your needs
quakes <- eq_clean_data()
quakes_filtered <- quakes %>%
        filter(COUNTRY %in% c("PERU") & YEAR >= 1960)

# single country without labels
ggplot() +
        geom_timeline(data = quakes_filtered, aes(x = date, y = COUNTRY, color = TOTAL_DEATHS, size = EQ_PRIMARY)) +
        geom_timeline_label(data = quakes_filtered, aes(x = date,
                                                 y = COUNTRY,
                                                 magnitude = EQ_PRIMARY,
                                                 label = LOCATION_NAME,
                                                 n_max = 6)) +
        theme_classic()
```


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  fig.width = 15, fig.asp = .42}
# Load the data and filter it accordingly to your needs
quakes <- eq_clean_data()
quakes_filtered <- quakes %>%
        filter(COUNTRY %in% c("ECUADOR", "PERU", "CHILE") & YEAR >= 1000)

# single country without labels
ggplot() +
        geom_timeline(data = quakes_filtered, aes(x = date, y = COUNTRY, color = TOTAL_DEATHS, size = EQ_PRIMARY)) +
        geom_timeline_label(data = quakes_filtered, aes(x = date,
                                                 y = COUNTRY,
                                                 magnitude = EQ_PRIMARY,
                                                 label = LOCATION_NAME,
                                                 n_max = 4)) +
        theme_classic()
```


## Example - Leaflet Map

Besides the added timeline geom-functions, the package provides a few function which helps to easily create a `leaflet map`. What these functions do is shown below. Keep in mind that these are static maps, respectively print screens of the leaflet map (because the README.rm is a static file format). 

```{r}
# in addition to the earthquakesWithR package, we need:
require(leaflet)

```
