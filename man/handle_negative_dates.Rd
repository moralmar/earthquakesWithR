\description{
\code{handle_negative_dates} takes negative dates
}
\details{
This function takes ONLY negative dates in form three inputs:
year, month and the day. With some estimates and mirroring, it
gives back a date with a date-class, which is negative
Important to note is, that the return date is not 100% precise.
It is within +/- 5 days (accuracy). This is due to the mirroring
which was an estimate, and due to the fact that not all month were
equal in days.
